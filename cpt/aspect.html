<h2>The long-awaited (by me, for 2 years) <s>classpect</s> aspect text</h2>

<hr>

<p class='center'>Instructions:</p>
You will select one box, and <b>only one box</b>, out of the twelve boxes presented to you. The boxes are arranged in pairs of two. 
<br>You should select the box that contains words you resonate with / relate to. The words in the other pair should feel antagonistic. If you feel indifferent to one or both sides in a pair, then <b>neither box</b> is the correct option for you.
<p><i>(If you're still uncertain: the box that you dislike is often more obvious than the one you relate to.)</i>
