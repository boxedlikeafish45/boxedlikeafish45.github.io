<br>Those bound to the aspect of Mind are-you guessed it-the universe's great thinkers. But don't for a second think that means that they have all the answers. They are very concerned with remaining rational, and they have such a firm hold on the constant conjunction of their thinking that it's easy for them to see the multitudes of the choices laid out before them, which often leaves them frozen and unable to act. That said, when a Mind-bound finally launches into action, they can execute a plan with unbelievable grace and precision. Their identity is fluid-it can change from day-to-day, from thought-to-thought, from interaction-to-interaction. Remaining logical is more important to them than building up a solid foundation of "self." At their best they are great innovators, architects, and creators. At their worst they can be nasty, inflexible, and indecisive.<p>

<br>Regardless of whether there is any actual interplay between the literal right or left brain, the Heart and Mind aspects create an intuitive dichotomy between obtrusive emotion and elegant ascendance - and indeed, the emotions the Heart aspect fixates on are always obtrusive. The Mind aspect, meanwhile, wants none of this: emotions are to be outmanuevered, appeased, waited out, or flat out ignored, all in the name of pursuing a fair (though not always happy) system of justice. Mind is a notch away from Space, and shares priorities with patience, detachment, and collectivism. Among this overlap, and more important than a subtle affinity for low temperatures (“cooler heads prevail” and what have you), is the fixation on choice; rather than our ability to choose, it is the outcome of those choices. The most poetic picture the Mind aspect can provide is that the world is a grand procession of cause/effect, and all our decisions should be weighed carefully if we want to come out better for it. Course, only the truly zealous classes will preach that, leaving Mind with the least identifiable aesthetic of any aspect - “smart?” and “math?” is not enough to go on. For the most part, if you want to identify a Mindbound, then you gotta look for someone trying to stuff down anything Heart-adjacent. Now sure, very few people have straightforward love lives, but it’s the Mindbound who would prefer it all so clinical, trying to cleanly navigate what can’t. Assuming they don’t weigh their career or other goals above relationships entirely, then the ones they have are chosen tactically, trying to engineer the most collective good, or guiltily regarded as failing that. (Hopefully) unrelated to this, Mind even shares some of Heart’s mask-making, but more for the pragmatism of tangible results in different social contexts...and if emotions need to be forced, or outright invented, it is Mind’s ideology that can best justify those acts. This isn’t to say they’re sociopaths (even if they might want to be) or philistines (which is more a Time thing), but the philosophical clarity the Mindbound chase requires that all the messy stuff is <s>repressed</s> regulated.<p>

<br>It is the signature of the Heart and Mind aspects to mythologize their emotions and goals respectively, blossoming either into a flower that overtakes the other. Regardless of favouritism, this is the same framework - even moreso than it initially appears. There are logical approaches to life, but no logical destinations, no “objective success”. Mind is less machine as it is simply faux-superego, chasing objectivity with the most palletable cultivation of subjectivity; why speak for only yourself, when you can - no, should - speak for everyone? More than ever, it should be apparent why the Mind aspect rests between Space and Hope, as there is a longing to escape the more material inverted aspect - which is only, you know, literally personal bias. Sure, Heart is openly self-sabotaging, openly unpleasant, openly illogical - yet, does its efforts to systemize and organize itself create a logic in protest? Is there not inherent categorization in which desires are more “deserving”? Whether this is bleedover or a true mirror of Mind’s systemization, it goes both ways: is the “calm chessmaster” anything besides another mask? Is the culling of emotion not simply picking favourites? Run rampant, the Mindbound demonize all errant emotions until the depressive shame creates a feedback loop, and the Heartbound mythologize identity to the point it is divorced of any brain it represents. If the Heartbound enshrine their obtrusive multifacets, is the Mind’s craving for apersonal enlightenment not one more? If the Mindbound seek unbiased clarity, is it not hypocritical to reject these compulsions, rather than organize them as well? In synthesis, the system of the soul, where intellect admits what it has to gain, where one selects which masks define the whole, and where understanding and empathy beget each other. To say anything more is to kill the point, and take the adventure of self-discovery from those who cherish it the most.<p>
