<h2>Rage</h2>

<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Rage are bringers of chaos. They posses great contempt for lies or false ideas, including the stability that false ideas can impart. To them, the true is far more important than the good; they would tear down a system just to destabilize it if, by their reckoning, it is built on faulty premises. Often the Rage-bound prefer anarchy to any of the alternate forms of civilization, which they believe to be riddled with lies and foolishness and obedient masses. They are bringers of confusion and doubt, and they can be frustratingly difficult to convince otherwise when they have attached themselves to an idea. If they sound dangerous, they are. The Rage-bound tend to be most volatile and unpredictable of the aspects. At their best they are original, revolutionary, and fearless. At their worst they are cruel, uncompromising, and vicious.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure:</b>
<br>Moving in a moodier direction than Heart, Rage gets its eponymous name from centering on the most obtrusive emotion of all, and all worldly obtrusions that (should) evoke it. More than contrast, Rage is almost some kind of natural predator to Hope, with a fetishization of disappointment and wake-up-calls. This bitterness is not exactly compassionate, but is seen as a justice: hatred is honest, memory defines us, failure teaches us, apologies are worthless, and the world’s cruelties exist for a reason...right? Rage is, despite itself, a dogma, adhering to the belief that the truth hurts, what hurts is probably true, and it is noble to exemplify both those things. Now, they’re not (inherently) bullies or anything, and more timid classes will only demonstrate this situationally against carefully decided targets, but Ragebounds tend to believe that insulting someone’s hairstyle or choice of music is equally important as any actual point they’re making - humility through humiliation, so to say. Still, this destructive streak can fester into a contempt for any happiness besides schadenfraude, zealously eager to break apart someone’s “lesser” comprehension of reality...which leads into how precarious it is to worship an idea of truth that surplants genuine observation. Ragebounds are prone to mistrust facts and testimony unless it is satisfyingly (or conveniently) caustic, making them arrogantly skeptical on nothing but their gut, while thinking being smug is, itself, an argument. If this gets out of hand, the pursuit of “truthier truths” dismisses anything outside its manufactured mythology, making the Ragebound increasingly conspiratorial in their sole sobriety. While both [Hope and Rage] can motivate and shake foundations, having your head in the clouds or feet on the ground work better as methodology - not the point.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>Hope and Rage are naturally combative in a way few aspects are, but this facet only highlights the commonality of “defiance”; one champions beliefs strong enough to break any ceiling, while the other lives in grim worship of the ceiling and its capability to beat back the petulant. As both exist inside in the same individual, schisms within create schisms without, resulting in a sub-axis of “Whatever you say, it’s not worth the argument” and “You’re bullshit and everything you say is bullshit”...but either approach can surround an idealistic or practical worldview, and the nature of inversion only further highlights the blurred lines between them. All the sweetest sentiments and promising possibilities the Hope aspect can muster won’t get anywhere without the pragmatism to engineer them, or the raw wrath to stand by them in the face of everything; if the odds really are a million to one, you need to be able to admit that, or you won’t have any chance at all. Likewise, Rage still needs some principles to hold to, some beauty worth defending, or its only remaining ideal (hypocritically) is nothing besides bitter resignation, indiscriminate humiliation, and self-sabotaging spirals. There’s something to be said about how the “reality and fantasy” angle is similar to the Time and Space axis, but this is so much less existential contemplation and so much more rallying cries. Hope and Rage create individuals driven to question what is, expose or champion falsehoods (sometimes both), pick apart the foundation, demand better in moral outrage, tearing away at life’s shit-coated ugly while capable of the most honest appreciations of what can’t be removed - and perhaps, why it shouldn’t be. With practice and maturation, they are capable of miracles that move mountains, or the gentle grace of making everything feel okay when nothing else can be done. The silver lining and the stormcloud - but always better with the thunder to back it up.<p>
