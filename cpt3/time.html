<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Time are fighters, full stop. Their lives are often marked by struggle, not so much because fate has it in for them, but because they are fundamentally incapable of just accepting things as they come. They value action over passive acceptance, even if that may not be the wisest or safest choice. Don't try to tell a Time-bound to sit still and look pretty. They are very goal-focused, and tend to value the destination over the journey, and you won't find them making that journey in any traditional sort of way. To quote cheesy posters found on many a guidance counselor's wall-"impossible is just a word". If you need a miracle, they are who you call. At their best, the Time-bound are empathetic and relentless problem-solvers. At their worst they are ruthless, defensive, and impulsive.<p>

<br>Defining the extreme points on the axis of “Is” and “Isn’t”, Space and Time are aspects that overthink the essentials of existence; Space is a masturbatory belief about beliefs, where Time is a paradoxical belief against beliefs. (...) One could call the Time aspect “cone-flavoured ice-cream” - which is to say, an ideological fixation on the material world, excluding the messy opinions that distract from survival in the present moment. The snag is, Time is still <s>ice-cream</s> a belief, deifying nihilism to the point that dog-eat-dog becomes dogma. This catalytic, cataclysmic node of thought venerates the immortal spite of the human infestation, in a profane mockery of beauty itself; fire and lightning, flesh and machinery, combustion and cannibalism, and all the rest of that rock ‘n’ roll imagery. Now, all of this isn’t to say the Timebound themselves are inherently feral; rather, just predisposed to believe it’ll always come down to grit on anything that matters. This viewpoint and its expectations leaves them in a state of permanent unease: the world is cruel, people are fragile, art is meaningless, and all things are temporary. Far from Space’s belonging, the Timebound fear the world is out to get them, and rationalizing what hurts you and yours is wasting effort you could spend doing something about it. Still, while the good intentions of “righteous and necessary violence” can manifest through this primordially blunt worldview, “death and destruction” is seductive in the naked admission of its own vapid ignorance; that so much in life does die is harder to live with than should. Pragmatism or thrill-seeking are possible permutations of the aspect, and unfortunately equally valid as “the weak will serve the strong” horseshit, waiting to freefall into omnicidal wrath with the right shove. Even reasonable Timebounds will burn more bridges in life than they’ll build - or at least, be convinced that they and humanity are capable of nothing more, no matter how empty that makes them feel. Ultimately, neither Space nor Time can rid itself of the other, in individuals or in life; they are two halves of the human spirit, and without compromise, they are both broken.<p>

<br>Space and Time have the most and least incentive to change respectively. Time’s paradoxical status as “the belief against beliefs” breaks upon reflection, like Wile E. Coyote over a cliff. As inevitably as it fetishizes inevitabilities, the Time aspect cannibalizes itself: the “belief of the material world” was never more than hypocrisy, where the idea that the vast uncaring universe has any kind of objective victory condition - let alone “money, sex, and power” - is grossly naive. None of it ever mattered, none of it could ever matter, nothing has ever mattered, we will all pass into bleak oblivion and we may as well have done nothing at all. Time is as much a lying delusion as it accused Space of being (which it still totally is), but the only way to make either true is to see the other side: live wire in the silent garden, artist in the screaming meat fuck. Time’s obsession with the material can evolve from projection to honest deference, where Space flourishes in a world it wrote off; that when nothing matters, everything matters, and the complete lack of any “grand scheme of things” means every possible concept of every possible thing is exactly as significant as we choose for it to be. Space’s concepts become convictions to be fought and killed over, while Time expands surrender past a cosmic will, into the now multicoloured meatscape of humanity - every loss is someone else’s win, to die is one more great adventure. Between the bindings of “I gotta” and “I cannot intervene”, there is the only true proof of existence, and the only true choice: “I’m gonna do whatever the fuck I want, and whatever happens, happens”. Time would rather imagine itself a corpse or machine, just as much as Space would imagine itself a flower or cloud, but only together do they make where the falling angel meets the rising ape - a miracle of matter, a god unto itself. a human being.<p>

<p><small>If this one seems a bit more personal (or, hell, inaccurate), that's because d3wdr0p is a time player. I noticed this in a few sections of the document myself (since we share the same class), but one can't easily quantify what they already are.</small>
