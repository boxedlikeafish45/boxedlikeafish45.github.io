<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Void are the universe's secret-keepers. The unknown doesn't scare them-where others might see emptiness, they see potential. A blank page, an empty canvas, that's what the Void-bound live for. They value mystery and the unexplained, and are not particularly bothered by not having all the answers. Where others might be compelled to go out and seek answers, the Void-bound lean more toward casting doubt on what is already considered fully understood. They don't take much on faith and would rather live in a state of confusion than believe something that might be untrue or bow to intellectual authority. After all, in order for something new to be built, the old, rotting foundation must often be razed. At their best, Void-bound are wise, intuitive, and vibrant. At their worst they can be dismissive, indecisive, and apathetic.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure:</b>
<br>The Void aspect is Space’s somehow-more-depressing sibling, finding value in exactly the kind of unsatisfying lack of payoff Light abhors. It revels in uncommitted ambiguity, contemplating what surprises lie outside our perception, and how meager our preconceptions are in the face of such hypotheticals. “Doubt” is the most intrinsic quality of the Voidbound, and probably the reason it’s hard to name any others; if life is a puzzle, then the Voidbound don’t believe in corner pieces, or even the picture on the box. It is a bit of a coinflip, however, if they think “the truth is out there” waiting to be discovered by those wise enough to never trust anything for certain...or if existence truly is nothing more than cheerful nonsense, only ruined if you try to force it into order. The more you look for answers, the more you could wind up wasting your time, or find something you can’t unsee. Then again, some Voidbounds can spend so much time imagining what’s out there that they’ll argue based on wild hunches they either can’t or won’t clarify - sometimes, without admitting they’re hunches. Confusion can be a valuable state of mind, embraced or encouraged, spiritually or tactically. Still, while the Lightbound are dangerously overcertain of all-they-can-be, the Voidbound...well, “lack”. Whatever class they are is composed of values they - by definition - cannot articulate, where self-reflection challenges self-confidence. Hunches and flights of fancy are their preferred state of being for the reason of their lack of reason, where being truly known can feel equal parts impossible and precarious. The Lightbound rarely see their true potential, but where the Voidbound often do, they simply do not recognize it as such.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>It is the Lightbound’s rigid definitions of their primary class that makes them the most in need of inversion - or rather, to have it directly pointed out to them all the many times they’ve already been their Void class, expressing Void-flavoured sentiments. Then again, what truly is “Void-flavoured”? Even the Voidbound themselves often don’t know, making their Lightsided inversion not only easier for themselves to describe, but often their most memorable qualities to those around them; the part that stands out, the part that talks, the part that confronts. You wanna know what Void is? It is freedom without Breath’s purposeful optimism, subjectivity without needing Heart’s violent passion, and expression without Space’s greater calling. The Void aspect asks for nothing and provides nothing - in doing so, it reflects the individual clearer than any other. Whim, hobbies, emotions, ideas, only ever sorted as unsorted, all shrouded in a shrug; the associated class embraces or encourages this state, then does whatever it wanted to do in the closest display of free will. And yet, a side will always contemplate and pine for those constrictive conclusions of “destiny” - one more delusion, as all aspects are. Symbols are not of the material world, not a tangible thing, but they run alongside it; man cannot exist without making a narrative over what’s in front of us. It is Void that tempers these cathartic calls to action, sorting legend and history, myth and nonsense. In the retreat, Void makes its own meanings, and appreciates those that have none yet; although, “don’t rush to conclusions” is a conclusion itself, possibly from someone who’s trying to avoid what the Light might see. It’s important not to decide what did or didn’t happen - only to choose how relevant we want it to be, drawing constellations in the sky. Everyone has a story, and we all get to choose what it is - even if we think it was chosen for us, and even if we think we never did.<p>
