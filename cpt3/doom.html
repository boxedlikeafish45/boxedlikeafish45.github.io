<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Doom are fate's chosen sufferers. It may not sound like an overly pleasant aspect to be aligned with, but it does come along with great wisdom and empathy. The Doom-bound understand that misery loves company, and they are ready and willing to provide said company. The Doom-bound won't fix you; they aren't healers. They are commiserators, aware that sometimes the only thing you can do for a person is let them know that they are not alone in their suffering. They are not the advice friend-they're the friend you go to when you need to vent about a rough day at work. They are not necessarily noble martyrs, either-the Doom-bound can become quite irate about their lot. At their best they are wise, kind, and non-judgemental. At their worst, bitter, resentful, and fatalistic.<p>

<br>...it is the fetishization of stability that ultimately destines [the aspect of Life] for instability. “Destined instability”, however, has a name: Doom. It is the aspect of pessimism, decay, languishing, and probably just the emo/goth scene as a whole. While ocassionally fascinated by death and our futility towards it, it is not the adrenaline-filled conflicts of Time, but rather, a perspective on loss, grief, and the contented numbing that comes with processing all of that. Indeed, “contented numbing” overlaps with the directly-adjacent Void, even if Doom has no innate interest in secrets and strays even further from Space’s lack of bias; in all the intangibles of what could be, expect only disappointment, as all good things come to an end and leave you lesser. The Doombound themselves, however, are all quite accustomed to this state of mind, and fairly in tune with the positives that come from not having a goddamn thing to prove to anyone. If it all rots eventually, then bothering to hold on to relationships, morals, or dignity can feel insulting, especially if it’s societal and not anything personally chosen, While it isn’t unfair to regard this as an eternal personal raincloud of “unproductive bellyaching”, the Doombound can be both greatly approachable or emotionally suffocating - sometimes both. Genuine compassion shines all the more in contrast, from someone with no expectations of others as much as themself...though, sympathy alone is not enough for everyone. Even to the Doombound themselves, there’s cracks from what they only thought they could tolerate or give up on, worn down by an aspect that may as well be surgically designed to justify self-sabotage and willful isolation. Between Stepford Smiles or eye rolls, arguments of happiness’s surplus or scarcity only reach the same result: failure by futility, or failure by design.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>Aspects are not any kind of literal elemental energy, and it’s those who aren’t bound to an axis who most plainly see that and avoid overcomplicating the solutions they want; for this pair, the mythological war between pitching in or wallowing hurts everyone. For the Lifebound, trying to create a perfect happy community from the top down is itself a doomed effort, where being unable to admit the problems makes those problems worse. For the Doombound, “rot for rot’s sake” extremism starves both the inverted Life aspect’s cravings, and the basic human need for socialization; what compromises and comraderie come about are still tentative, if misery and isolation are still seen as some “default” that all will - or should - return to. If the goalposts are placed exclusively on impossible perfection or all-consuming pessimism, then the mundane subject matter of friendships, community, and depression all become warped beyond recognition. To lecture others on the dread they should be feeling, the healing they should be wanting, all reflects far more on the zealous conniptions of the individual saying it. To recognize the other side of oneself in inversion still creates a binary, still deifies every smile or sneer, when the best resolution is far more likely to involve deference. Engineering an ideal social environment will ultimately require cooperation, built from many preferences and perspectives that - 5 times out of 6 - will not involve an axis that obsesses on it. To manifest anything, one has to understand the minutia of health and sickness first, without demanding storybook endings (even grim ones). The romance comes from appreciating what’s already there, and intentionally invoking greater imagery if it helps in the one thing both aspects agree on: comfort. In radiance, in rot; from ability, to need. In every result and process, every struggle or resignation, a beauty that transcends and ties together the best and worst of all of us.<p>
