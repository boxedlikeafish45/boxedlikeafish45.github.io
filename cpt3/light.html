<h2>Light</h2>

<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Light are the universe's knowledge-seekers. They are, above all, driven to learn and understand. They are great alchemists, able to take multiple sources of information and synthesize them into something useful. They are scholars and researchers, absolutely dedicated to knowledge for knowledge's sake. They are the ultimate students, and although that might conjure up the image of people sitting around peacefully waiting for knowledge to be brought to them, that couldn't be further from the truth. The Light-bound will go after knowledge with a fierce intensity that others may find distasteful. They aren't overly concerned with laws or norms, either. They often take rules as simple suggestions, instead searching for loopholes or work-arounds. At their best, the Light-bound are resourceful and driven. At their worst they can be fussy, pedantic, and insensitive.<p>

<br>The Light aspect presents itself as a seeker of great truths, unifying and guiding those that find it - and while that’s not technically wrong, it’s important to realize that anything one notch off from Time is looking for catharsis before anything else. Light expands where Time reduces, turning blunt judgements into resplendent archetypes, all in the name of clean and compelling narratives. While the Lightbound (probably) do not literally believe their world a fiction, they are often eccentric in arranging it as though it was one; stories, titles, myths, popularity contests, tropes and cliches, all treated as tangible enough to trust and work off of. Even if they (consciously) put this aside, there’s still an innate superstition that colours their worldview: what they expect to happen is what ought to happen (do not bring Lightbounds to casinos). If life is a puzzle, the Lightbound are way, way, way too quick to assume they found all the corner pieces; that any and all unknowns uncovered may still be fit to existing, verified categorizations, and that the most annoying thing people can do is not stick to their scripts. Even in the face of doubt, Light’s complexity compounds, rationalizing curveballs away with a lust for answers that only answers itself. The aspect that pertains to relevant information ironically obscures the most relevant fact of all: stories are comforting more often than they are true. The ability to connect dots does not mean the dots should be connected, leaving the Lightbound chasing a “grand destiny” they don’t realize they’re inventing. “Luck” may be the more accurate name, but Lightbound find it difficult to admit their worldview hinges on coincidence; to keep the golden flame of fervor going, you’re going to need to burn alot of books. The Lightbound rarely see their true potential, but where the Voidbound often do, they simply do not recognize it as such.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>It is the Lightbound’s rigid definitions of their primary class that makes them the most in need of inversion - or rather, to have it directly pointed out to them all the many times they’ve already been their Void class, expressing Void-flavoured sentiments. Then again, what truly is “Void-flavoured”? Even the Voidbound themselves often don’t know, making their Lightsided inversion not only easier for themselves to describe, but often their most memorable qualities to those around them; the part that stands out, the part that talks, the part that confronts. You wanna know what Void is? It is freedom without Breath’s purposeful optimism, subjectivity without needing Heart’s violent passion, and expression without Space’s greater calling. The Void aspect asks for nothing and provides nothing - in doing so, it reflects the individual clearer than any other. Whim, hobbies, emotions, ideas, only ever sorted as unsorted, all shrouded in a shrug; the associated class embraces or encourages this state, then does whatever it wanted to do in the closest display of free will. And yet, a side will always contemplate and pine for those constrictive conclusions of “destiny” - one more delusion, as all aspects are. Symbols are not of the material world, not a tangible thing, but they run alongside it; man cannot exist without making a narrative over what’s in front of us. It is Void that tempers these cathartic calls to action, sorting legend and history, myth and nonsense. In the retreat, Void makes its own meanings, and appreciates those that have none yet; although, “don’t rush to conclusions” is a conclusion itself, possibly from someone who’s trying to avoid what the Light might see. It’s important not to decide what did or didn’t happen - only to choose how relevant we want it to be, drawing constellations in the sky. Everyone has a story, and we all get to choose what it is - even if we think it was chosen for us, and even if we think we never did.<p>
