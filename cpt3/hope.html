<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Hope are driven first and foremost by their convictions. They do right for right's sake, and are quick to come to the aid of anyone they deem to be experiencing injustice. That said, their views of the world can be quite black and white, so what they see as the "right" thing may not always be the universally accepted view. They put great value in the power of the imagination, the ability to dream up a better and more beautiful future. If anyone could dream a better world into existence, it would be one of the Hope-bound. They may sound like all sunshine and rainbows, but they aren't adverse to a little destruction, especially if they think they can replace it with something better and more just. At their best, Hope-bound are positive, caring, and warm. At their worst they can be narrow-minded and selfish.<p>

<br>The Hope aspect veers further from Space than Mind did, where “Ideal risks” sharpen into “million-to-one shots that fix everything”; it’s a pretty distinctive niche of the human psyche and our myths, already dissected and discussed, and all we’re clarifying are those with their self-identity tied to it. The Hopebound possess an ever-present lurch of optimistic imagination - that friends (or strangers) can be trusted and everything will come up aces eventually, no matter the odds (or precedent) of that not coming to pass. There’s just this deep-rooted indignity to it all, either feeling their circumstances are worth exemption from rules, or that said rules are loose enough they shouldn’t be enforced, or that the rules are plain wrong and deserve rewriting. There is a charisma to their wild ideas, but not often strategy, and limits to their ability to sell these ideas to themselves as much as others. Hope is an unwieldly aspect, with those on a winning streak still worried of how long they can keep it up (or pretend to be keeping it up), and those in dire straits incapable of practical solutions; the deeper the pit, the higher they’re convinced they’ll need to jump. It’s not (all) delusion: it’s defiance, most days, from someone personally insulted at the cards they were dealt, retaliating by either throwing it back in the dealer’s face or betting the damn farm. Hope is an aspect of never-say-die saviors, bold innovations that cut through what was once set in stone, sincere faith in a future that cannot come about without faith...or the aspect of broken promises and blind denial, blowing their money on scratch tickets while they try to aggressively pretend everything’s fine - sometimes, fairly convincingly. No matter the intent, the Hope aspect is very dangerous in its ability to appear as anything but. While both [Hope and Rage] can motivate and shake foundations, having your head in the clouds or feet on the ground work better as methodology - not the point.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>Hope and Rage are naturally combative in a way few aspects are, but this facet only highlights the commonality of “defiance”; one champions beliefs strong enough to break any ceiling, while the other lives in grim worship of the ceiling and its capability to beat back the petulant. As both exist inside in the same individual, schisms within create schisms without, resulting in a sub-axis of “Whatever you say, it’s not worth the argument” and “You’re bullshit and everything you say is bullshit”...but either approach can surround an idealistic or practical worldview, and the nature of inversion only further highlights the blurred lines between them. All the sweetest sentiments and promising possibilities the Hope aspect can muster won’t get anywhere without the pragmatism to engineer them, or the raw wrath to stand by them in the face of everything; if the odds really are a million to one, you need to be able to admit that, or you won’t have any chance at all. Likewise, Rage still needs some principles to hold to, some beauty worth defending, or its only remaining ideal (hypocritically) is nothing besides bitter resignation, indiscriminate humiliation, and self-sabotaging spirals. There’s something to be said about how the “reality and fantasy” angle is similar to the Time and Space axis, but this is so much less existential contemplation and so much more rallying cries. Hope and Rage create individuals driven to question what is, expose or champion falsehoods (sometimes both), pick apart the foundation, demand better in moral outrage, tearing away at life’s shit-coated ugly while capable of the most honest appreciations of what can’t be removed - and perhaps, why it shouldn’t be. With practice and maturation, they are capable of miracles that move mountains, or the gentle grace of making everything feel okay when nothing else can be done. The silver lining and the stormcloud - but always better with the thunder to back it up.<p>
