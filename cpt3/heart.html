<br>Those bound to the aspect of Heart are very concerned with their favorite subject: themselves. It wouldn't be a stretch to call them 'self-obsessed', but not necessarily in a negative way. They simply want to understand the one thing we all are stuck with for our entire lives, i.e. our own minds. Forging an identity is extremely important to the Heart-bound, and every decision and action goes toward building a coherent narrative of their own story. That isn't to say Heart-bound don't care deeply for their friends and allies; they just have a tendency to assume that everyone is as concerned with identity as they are. They are excellent at putting on and taking off masks as the situation calls for them. At their best, they are competent, imaginative, and steady. At their worst they can be overbearing, inflexible, and cold.<p>

<br>Regardless of whether there is any actual interplay between the literal right or left brain, the Heart and Mind aspects create an intuitive dichotomy between obtrusive emotion and elegant ascendance - and indeed, the emotions the Heart aspect fixates on are always obtrusive. Heart mythologizes the wildest, loudest, and hottest passions into a representation of someone’s pure soul, where self-sabotage proves it’s genuine and contradiction proves complexity. It is a fixation on identity, along with which identities compliment each other and how; while it’s not always romantic (even though it usually is) or implying that they’re all flirts (even though they usually are), nobody romanticizes romance like a Heartbound - and rarely anything subtle compared to the wild, destructive obsessions of “I’d choose you even if the world burns”. Even alone, the Heartbound are distinctive in how their sense of identity is never tidy, with the explorations on their “deep soul” looping in on itself. There’s an intrinsic fascination with inventing new masks and affects and roles, often as much for charismatic improv as the contemplations that these constructs all reflect parts of themselves - noble, true, antagonistic, buried, etc. One of the more curious habits is treating these personas as capable of a dialogue and thoughts of their own, which is not to say being Heartbound is synonymous with DID, only that they are very susceptible to becoming lost in their own reflection. Stemming from this, many Heartbounds will pride themselves on empathic intuition, but it’s a coinflip if any of that lands - really, wrong guesses call into question if the Heartbounds are even investigating anyone’s psyche or just making shit up. Ultimately, “The heart wants what it wants” and “I must be true to myself” are the only justifications given, the only justifications needed, all from individuals bound to a dogma that is - and let’s call a spade a spade here - anti-logic.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>It is the signature of the Heart and Mind aspects to mythologize their emotions and goals respectively, blossoming either into a flower that overtakes the other. Regardless of favouritism, this is the same framework - even moreso than it initially appears. There are logical approaches to life, but no logical destinations, no “objective success”. Mind is less machine as it is simply faux-superego, chasing objectivity with the most palletable cultivation of subjectivity; why speak for only yourself, when you can - no, should - speak for everyone? More than ever, it should be apparent why the Mind aspect rests between Space and Hope, as there is a longing to escape the more material inverted aspect - which is only, you know, literally personal bias. Sure, Heart is openly self-sabotaging, openly unpleasant, openly illogical - yet, does its efforts to systemize and organize itself create a logic in protest? Is there not inherent categorization in which desires are more “deserving”? Whether this is bleedover or a true mirror of Mind’s systemization, it goes both ways: is the “calm chessmaster” anything besides another mask? Is the culling of emotion not simply picking favourites? Run rampant, the Mindbound demonize all errant emotions until the depressive shame creates a feedback loop, and the Heartbound mythologize identity to the point it is divorced of any brain it represents. If the Heartbound enshrine their obtrusive multifacets, is the Mind’s craving for apersonal enlightenment not one more? If the Mindbound seek unbiased clarity, is it not hypocritical to reject these compulsions, rather than organize them as well? In synthesis, the system of the soul, where intellect admits what it has to gain, where one selects which masks define the whole, and where understanding and empathy beget each other. To say anything more is to kill the point, and take the adventure of self-discovery from those who cherish it the most.<p>
