<h2>Breath</h2>

<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Breath are, above all, expansive. Flexible and driven, they leave an impact wherever they go. Like the breeze itself, they are able to sweep others up to carry along in their wake, but also like the breeze, they can be difficult to catch hold of or tie down. Although Breath-bound do make very good leaders, breath tends to be a very personal aspect. Often, heroism comes along as an offshoot of them pursuing their own personal stories. They lead by example, and will routinely be surprised that others look up to or feel inspired by them. They have a tendency to underestimate themselves, and not always out of poor self-esteem. They were just doing their own thing. At their best Breath-bound are motivated, adaptable, and forward thinking, but at their worst they can be volatile, avoidant, and gullible.<p>

<br>The second axis of aspects really couldn’t care less if the mind is looking internal or external, resulting in two aspects equally as likely to find unifying threads between all aspects as ignore the “big picture” stuff altogether, while their lack of internal interrogation makes them reliable in how they trust others and themselves at face value. The Breath aspect is the absolute peak of positivity, transcending the limitations of both Hope and Life by assuring with complete sincerity that “Everything is going to be okay, eventually”. The specific details and structure of the future, be it imagined or observed, are rendered irrelevant as Breath positions it’s full faith in this stress-free peace of mind, as contagious as it is indefatigable. Pain is temporary, promises were made in an old world that doesn’t exist anymore, leave behind what (or who) isn’t working for you, and you’ll find your path someway, somehow. If Breath falters, it doesn’t need an argument to reassert itself; only the vibe must return, feeling like this obvious constant you didn’t really lose so much as forgot you always had. The Breathbound are steadfast, accommodating, and resilient enough to make excellent figureheads...but, it is that vague sense of the future that betrays a lack of endgame, and the humble wisdom that bypasses so many existential concerns can be a buffer against not actually having a real answer. Believing in tomorrow is charismatic, but not prediction, all while the assurances easily turn incestuous: resolved of the need to justify itself, or assert itself at all. Finding simple solutions can mean little besides the path of least resistance, where it doesn’t matter if you’re bored or depressed, only that you’re relaxed. Breath is blissful, independent freedom - and sometimes, even often, not a damn thing else. Breath and Blood both create some powerfully single-minded people, unifying groups under banners whether it’s theirs or not...but if they don’t want to lose them, they have to listen, not just talk.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>That the Blood aspect encourages leaders is obvious - that Breath does, less so. Breath breaks away from the old, forgives sins, forgets grudges, soothes all pain, and insists that the past is the past; while this assurance of an optimistic future is innately magnetic, why does it care about who listens, let alone who follows? Blood is very much sins, grudges, punishment, sacrifice and staying in the past...but then, why coordinate to goals at all, if suffering itself is a core tenant? The proclivity to leadership is built out of both aspects, regardless of which one is the figurehead; in a vacuum, they are only reliefs to that role, either seduced to new frontiers or humbled back into line. Yet, with these aspects doing their best to avoid internal conflict, the balance between them is fickle. Blood and Breath still too easily redouble themselves into absolutes judged worthy by itself, where Breathbound have completely relieved themselves of the burden of others burdens, and the Bloodbound harden grudges and expect debts until everyone isn’t “pulling their weight”. In this haze of immediate intuition, both aspects will create people too goddamn pleased with themselves to realize no one’s happy - not even them. It is principle beyond interrogation - only “Freedom” and “Family” - where only the simplest (not easiest) solutions are sought. The truth is, these might actually be the hardest aspects to balance, where the inversion is only seen in harsh snaps - but those can still be harsh snaps that are chosen. The advice here is not about what concepts these two aspects explore together, but for those bound to snap out of their seductive dogma for a second and ask what they actually want to do; what traditions to keep, what innovations to try, which friends to keep, which friends to make, what to punish, what to forgive, why why why? You have to to take back control of your life, or you’ll either give it to everyone else, or forget you ever had it in the first place.<p>

<p><small>Hi! I'm a Page of Breath. You found me. We're buddies now.
<br>While I'm here, I'd just like to say that I see the blood-breath axis as the burnout-dissociation axis, respectively. It's mostly a funny catchphrase for me, but I'd like to think it at least means SOMETHING.</small>
