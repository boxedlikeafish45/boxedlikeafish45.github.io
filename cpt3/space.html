<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Space are, as the name suggests, concerned with the big picture. They are patient, masters of the art of 'wait-and-see', and are inclined to take things as they come. That isn't to say that they're pushovers or willing to let injustice lie-they just choose their battles wisely, understanding that sometimes you have to let something burn to the ground in order to build it back better and stronger than before. To this effect, they tend to be innovators, concerned with creation and redemption. Catch them recycling the old to make the new, the fresh, and the beautiful. For the Space-bound, the journey is as, if not more, important than the destination; how they do something is as important as what they do. At their best, they are steady, impartial, and creative. At their worst, they can be detached, apathetic, and vague.<p>

<br>Defining the extreme points on the axis of “Is” and “Isn’t”, Space and Time are aspects that overthink the essentials of existence; Space is a masturbatory belief about beliefs, where Time is a paradoxical belief against beliefs. The Space aspect is less “vanilla”, and more “ice-cream flavoured ice-cream”, venerating the rainbow tapestry of the human imagination, promoting a free-flowing creativity with no stakes, ownership, or pain. Its aesthetic signature defaults to gardens, withdrawal, and meditation - which basically either hits Buddhism directly, or by accident. They regard our ability to dream, to create, and to choose, as the most noble ability of a living being. A nurtured imagination helps them easily find new perspectives to uproot whatever’s at face value...if, perhaps, too easily convinced what they came up with is the new “correct” interpretation. All this flowery mumbo-jumbo (possibly involving actual flowers) makes the Spacebound innately amicable, with the snag that they often don’t seem to understand why everyone else isn’t. There is often an expectation that the strife of others is to be totally and cleanly solved by catching up to their wavelength; it’s certainly easier to advocate letting go of earthly attachments when you’re not the one attached, or aren’t defaultly inclined to make attachments, or just won’t admit the attachments you take for granted. Barring some real introspection (or, maybe more importantly, extrospection), the Spacebound are inventing the greater tranquility everyone should “surrender” to, which is far more likely to reflect their class rather than genuine wisdom. Pride and cruelty are never gone from the Spacebound, only coated in an aesthetic of the opposite, chasing purity when harmony looks like too much work. Ultimately, neither Space nor Time can rid itself of the other, in individuals or in life; they are two halves of the human spirit, and without compromise, they are both broken.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>Space and Time have the most and least incentive to change respectively. Time’s paradoxical status as “the belief against beliefs” breaks upon reflection, like Wile E. Coyote over a cliff. As inevitably as it fetishizes inevitabilities, the Time aspect cannibalizes itself: the “belief of the material world” was never more than hypocrisy, where the idea that the vast uncaring universe has any kind of objective victory condition - let alone “money, sex, and power” - is grossly naive. None of it ever mattered, none of it could ever matter, nothing has ever mattered, we will all pass into bleak oblivion and we may as well have done nothing at all. Time is as much a lying delusion as it accused Space of being (which it still totally is), but the only way to make either true is to see the other side: live wire in the silent garden, artist in the screaming meat fuck. Time’s obsession with the material can evolve from projection to honest deference, where Space flourishes in a world it wrote off; that when nothing matters, everything matters, and the complete lack of any “grand scheme of things” means every possible concept of every possible thing is exactly as significant as we choose for it to be. Space’s concepts become convictions to be fought and killed over, while Time expands surrender past a cosmic will, into the now multicoloured meatscape of humanity - every loss is someone else’s win, to die is one more great adventure. Between the bindings of “I gotta” and “I cannot intervene”, there is the only true proof of existence, and the only true choice: “I’m gonna do whatever the fuck I want, and whatever happens, happens”. Time would rather imagine itself a corpse or machine, just as much as Space would imagine itself a flower or cloud, but only together do they make where the falling angel meets the rising ape - a miracle of matter, a god unto itself. a human being.<p>

<p><small>If this one seems a bit more personal (or, hell, inaccurate), that's because d3wdr0p is a time player. I noticed this in a few sections of the document myself (since we share the same class), but one can't easily quantify what they already are (or... aren't, in this case).</small>
