<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Life are the universe's healers. They are concerned with the betterment of themselves and those around them, as well as the onward march of positive progress. Deeply empathetic, they have an intuitive understanding of other's suffering and the best way of righting those wrongs. If you're poisoned, chances are the Life-bound have something for what ails ya. This applies to both physical and mental suffering, though it might not be a cure you'll like. They also have the tendency to put other's needs before their own, which never ends well for anyone, because the Life-bound can grow bitter if they feel their own self-care has had to be shunted aside. At their best, they are great listeners, caretakers, and nurturers. At their worst, the Life-bound are passive aggressive, and pushy-they're certain they know best.<p>

<br>The Life aspect shares some of the archetype obligation from Light, but tempers it with an essential idealism: the only story being told is “and everyone lived happily ever after”. The Lifebound strive for health, sustainability, emotional wellness, cheerful communities, and fetishizes the smallest steps to get there. Life is tied for Hope in terms of positivity, but leaning to Time instead of Space is what defines its language of practical, tangible solutions, and the vigilance in keeping your hands busy. On a surface level, it seems like there’s no downsides, but the keyword is surface. The Life aspect still shares weaknesses with Light, misunderstanding impression and substance: trying to make people look healthy feels as valid as being healthy, all while far easier to engineer. Even this reliable practicality is a double edged sword, as the Life aspect never runs out of ways to slot itself into the lives of others, and self-perpetuates by trying to kill the voice that protests - “burnout” is in the realm of the Doom aspect, the enemy. Whatever class a person may have, the Life aspect will dominate the definition of that self-identity into “unpaid therapist”, inflicting a burden to carry their entire lives. Every Lifebound is, effectively, springlocked into smiling for (their projected perception of) everyone else’s benefit, and they will always snap eventually. In the end, Life can be as fragile as Hope, but the damage to their sense of self is not (inherently) from incredulity as much as fatigue, disgusted at the high cost of upkeep they can rarely admit is coming entirely from their own head; even if their friends want help,  the details of how much and in what way are often lost in translation through the deeply-worn conniptions. Again, “unpaid therapist”, but not always qualified to be a paid one either. No matter their best, it is the fetishization of stability that ultimately destines it for instability. Between Stepford Smiles or eye rolls, arguments of happiness’s surplus or scarcity only reach the same result: failure by futility, or failure by design.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>Aspects are not any kind of literal elemental energy, and it’s those who aren’t bound to an axis who most plainly see that and avoid overcomplicating the solutions they want; for this pair, the mythological war between pitching in or wallowing hurts everyone. For the Lifebound, trying to create a perfect happy community from the top down is itself a doomed effort, where being unable to admit the problems makes those problems worse. For the Doombound, “rot for rot’s sake” extremism starves both the inverted Life aspect’s cravings, and the basic human need for socialization; what compromises and comraderie come about are still tentative, if misery and isolation are still seen as some “default” that all will - or should - return to. If the goalposts are placed exclusively on impossible perfection or all-consuming pessimism, then the mundane subject matter of friendships, community, and depression all become warped beyond recognition. To lecture others on the dread they should be feeling, the healing they should be wanting, all reflects far more on the zealous conniptions of the individual saying it. To recognize the other side of oneself in inversion still creates a binary, still deifies every smile or sneer, when the best resolution is far more likely to involve deference. Engineering an ideal social environment will ultimately require cooperation, built from many preferences and perspectives that - 5 times out of 6 - will not involve an axis that obsesses on it. To manifest anything, one has to understand the minutia of health and sickness first, without demanding storybook endings (even grim ones). The romance comes from appreciating what’s already there, and intentionally invoking greater imagery if it helps in the one thing both aspects agree on: comfort. In radiance, in rot; from ability, to need. In every result and process, every struggle or resignation, a beauty that transcends and ties together the best and worst of all of us.<p>
