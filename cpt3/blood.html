<p><b>The Extended Zodiac:</b>
<br>Those bound to the aspect of Blood draw their strength from bonds, from the trust and camaraderie that blooms among a group of people who all share a single vision. Blood-bound are absolutely leaders, but they inhabit more of an inspirational role than a commanding one. They are prophets, rather than generals, giving others the strength and motivation to keep fighting. The Blood-bound can dispense excellent advice even when their own lives and interpersonal relationships are disasters. They can be very "do as I say, not as I do" types. A Blood-bound can often be found on a sinking ship, forcing an endeavor forward with sheer stubborn force of will. No matter how bad things go, a Blood-bound can always count on friends and allies. At their best, they are charismatic, uplifting, and magnetic. At their worst they can be sullen, unkind, and set-in-their-ways.<p>

<br>The second axis of aspects really couldn’t care less if the mind is looking internal or external, resulting in two aspects equally as likely to find unifying threads between all aspects as ignore the “big picture” stuff altogether, while their lack of internal interrogation makes them reliable in how they trust others and themselves at face value. The Blood aspect shares many of Breath’s strengths and weaknesses, in its lack of bias to tangible and intangible, giving it unique solutions and a certain rallying charisma. It is, however, still diametrically opposed, worshipping the past and all the pain that comes from holding on tight to what was, using that endurance of suffering to create bonds to last through thick and thin - family, born or forged. While “community and cooperation” may feel redundant to Life (blame the human genome), Blood has zero interest in being polite about its assurances, and mistrusts innovation compared to what works...or, doesn’t work. We suffer, and we suffer together; Blood is the aspect of martyrs, of donating kidneys to relatives you don’t even talk to anymore, and trying to endure a friend’s terrible choice of movie night. It does all of this while being too responsible to resemble Doom’s lackadaisy, or overthink the reliability of memory like Rage’s obsessions. Like Breath’s good moods, Blood’s bad moods don’t need to be argued, but it is the loyalty through that grim affect that can make Bloodbounds as magnetic as their inverse. If the Bloodbound have a reason to be grumpy, it’s because they’re sick of everyone’s shit, but also care about them deeply - though, this doesn’t mean they’ll always be justified in lashing out, either from an unrequited intensity, or a particularly petty definition of “everyone’s shit”. Just as with Breath’s vaguery, Blood can flounder on goals besides the purity of itself, as the burden of suffering loops into a sunk cost fallacy that’s a hard sell to the very people the Bloodbound requires to identify themselves. Likewise, this idea of “thick and thin” can result in pardoning - or encouraging - abuse, be it their own or others. Breath and Blood both create some powerfully single-minded people, unifying groups under banners whether it’s theirs or not...but if they don’t want to lose them, they have to listen, not just talk.<p>

<p><b>Classpect Brochure (inversion):</b>
<br>That the Blood aspect encourages leaders is obvious - that Breath does, less so. Breath breaks away from the old, forgives sins, forgets grudges, soothes all pain, and insists that the past is the past; while this assurance of an optimistic future is innately magnetic, why does it care about who listens, let alone who follows? Blood is very much sins, grudges, punishment, sacrifice and staying in the past...but then, why coordinate to goals at all, if suffering itself is a core tenant? The proclivity to leadership is built out of both aspects, regardless of which one is the figurehead; in a vacuum, they are only reliefs to that role, either seduced to new frontiers or humbled back into line. Yet, with these aspects doing their best to avoid internal conflict, the balance between them is fickle. Blood and Breath still too easily redouble themselves into absolutes judged worthy by itself, where Breathbound have completely relieved themselves of the burden of others burdens, and the Bloodbound harden grudges and expect debts until everyone isn’t “pulling their weight”. In this haze of immediate intuition, both aspects will create people too goddamn pleased with themselves to realize no one’s happy - not even them. It is principle beyond interrogation - only “Freedom” and “Family” - where only the simplest (not easiest) solutions are sought. The truth is, these might actually be the hardest aspects to balance, where the inversion is only seen in harsh snaps - but those can still be harsh snaps that are chosen. The advice here is not about what concepts these two aspects explore together, but for those bound to snap out of their seductive dogma for a second and ask what they actually want to do; what traditions to keep, what innovations to try, which friends to keep, which friends to make, what to punish, what to forgive, why why why? You have to to take back control of your life, or you’ll either give it to everyone else, or forget you ever had it in the first place.<p>
