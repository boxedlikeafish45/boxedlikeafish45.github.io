make sure to use the search box to find any cats by name / subspecies / mane / etc.<br>
  how to search: you can search two words and it will look for a result that contains both, to look for a specific phrase put the phrase in "quotes" !!!
  <br>if you click the arrow buttons it will sort by that column alphabetically or reverse alphabetically!

  // OK SO BASICALLY this website is very fragile for some reason?? some spreadsheets work and some dont so if you copy the testing spreadsheet (which is the line below) and work on that, it will most likely function?? bruh idk i tested this for too long. copy pasting works too, sometimes!
  // use this sheet for testing https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qT1LyvoAcb0HTsi2rHBltBVpUBumAUzT__rhMvrz5Rk/edit#gid=0

  // OK AND ANOTHER NOTE: you see how it say "query: select a,b,c" etc? you have to put in the letters of the columns (separated by commas, no spaces!). the order column is.. mostly useless lmao
$('#raw-table').sheetrock({
  url: mySpreadsheet,
  query: "select A,B,C,D,E,F,G order by A desc",
}).on('sheetrock:loaded', function () {
  $(this).DataTable();
});
