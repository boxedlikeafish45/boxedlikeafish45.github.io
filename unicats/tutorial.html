  here is the area where you can access the code to make your own website - https://github.com/boxedlikeafish45/boxedlikeafish45.github.io/blob/main/unicats/index.html
  <br>
  it uses data from google sheets so if you'd rather enter all of the information through a different source... this code is not for you :( you're better off finding your own thing
  <br>
  the code has been split up into several sections for your convenience! :) a basic understanding of how code works will help! a basic understanding of html will also be.. somewhat necessary if you want to put in your own instructions and all that ^^"
  
  
   
<p>
  NOW ON TO ACTUALLY EDITING THE CODE!
<br>
  the third section says var myspreadsheet - you should paste your spreadsheet <b>in between the quotation marks</b>
<br>
    this part is very fragile for some reason?? some spreadsheets work, and some just. don't
  
<br>
    if you make a copy of the testing spreadsheet  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qT1LyvoAcb0HTsi2rHBltBVpUBumAUzT__rhMvrz5Rk/edit#gid=0 and start working or copy-paste on that, it will most likely function??
  <br>
    sheetrock.js also has some rules for a working spreadsheet!! check them out here - https://chriszarate.github.io/sheetrock/#expectations PLEASE read the expectations section, it is important to get your website working right!!
<br>
    bruh idk i tested this for too long and i haven't been able to find a consistent rule!!! im sorry you're gonna have to use trial and error!! an online code editor, where you can see updates in real time, will help immensely with figuring out what works and what doesnt :(
  
  <br>
the fourth section says "query: select a,b,c". you have to put in the letters of the columns that you want displayed.
  <br> for example if you want the first 6 columns, you would put in A,B,C,D,E,F (all caps) which is separated by commas with no spaces! 
  <br>the order column is broken so you can ignore that part haha
